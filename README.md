# vietnamworks-extension
This plugin is developed by VietnamWorks in order to simplify the process of finding dream job, this extension will look for your dream job.

Two days ago at VietnamWorks we decided to build a simple chrome extension in order to help users that would like to receive job alert not in their mailbox. We think this is more convenient for users, we have launched our very beta version (MVP) now in order to measure the interest of our users.

Basically the extension looks like below:

ndeed we have built this extension completely open source and it is available on our GitHub. While we were building our very beta version and minimum functionalities, I learned a lot of cool things that made me like Chrome even more than before such as:

<ul>
   <li>You write them using web technologies such as HTML, JavaScript, and CSS</li>
   <li>Extensions bundle all their files into a single file that the user downloads and installs. This bundling means that, unlike ordinary web apps, extensions don't need to depend on content from the web which means it is very fast</li>
   <li>very simple and intuitive architecture</li>
   <li>Most methods in the chrome APIs are asynchronous: they return immediately, without waiting for the operation to finish</li>
   <li>easy to debug</li>
</ul>
